# Ventilator-Splitter
Texas Engineering World Health (TEWH) at UT Austin is an organization that prides itself in making low-cost medical devices and solutions for the developing world. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to design a low cost ventilator system that allows for multi-patient use. We used a motor to regulate affordable valves, and a pressure sensor and spirometer to give feedback to the valves of each patient to maintain the appropriate pressure ventilation settings.
